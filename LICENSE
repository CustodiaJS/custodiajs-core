This can be achieved through a clear mention in the user interface, at program startup, in the "About" information, in the documentation, or at a similar, easily visible location. A mere reference in the source code is not sufficient; end users of the program must know that "CutodiaJS-Core" is the foundation of the program.
3. Any modification of the source code must include a reference to the original "CutodiaJS-Core" project, similar to how Android projects maintain a reference to the original Android platform.
